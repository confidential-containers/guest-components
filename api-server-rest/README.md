# CoCo Restful API Server

CoCo guest components use lightweight ttRPC for internal communication to reduce the memory footprint and dependency. But many internal services also needed by containers like `get_resource`, `get_evidence` and `get_token`, we export these services with restful API, now CoCo containers can easy access these API with http client. Here are some examples, for detail info, please refer [rest API](./openapi/api.json)

```bash
$ ./api-server-rest --features=all
Starting API server on 127.0.0.1:8006
