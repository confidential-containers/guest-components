//! # Api definitions for KMS/Vault drivers
//!
//! To establish a connection between the client and the KMS/Vault server, two
//! kinds of parameters are required:
//! - Public parameters: like Region Id of the KMS/Vault, Instance Id of the KMS,
//! etc. They are not confidential and can be seen by anyone. [`ProviderSettings`]
//! is a json object. It is to include all the public parameters. The
//! hashmap style makes it flexible for different kinds of KMSes/Vaults. There
//! should be a function that takes a [`ProviderSettings`] as a input parameter
//! and returns a client instance.
//! - Private parameters: like the credential to access (e.g. access key).
//! These parameters should be captured inside the logic of `new()` rather
//! than the input parameter. it is strongly recommended that private parameters
//! be read from the encrypted filesystem, e.g. `/run/*` which is in TEE's
//! encrypted memory.
//!
//! ## APIs
//! - `Decrypter`: KMS's decrypt API.
//! - `Encrypter`: KMS's encrypt API.
//! - `Getter`: Vault's get secret API.
//! - `Setter`: Vault's set secret API.
//!
//! The rationality to distinguish these four different traits:
//! - `Decrypter` and `Getter` are used in-guest, while `Encrypter` and `Setter`
//! are used userside. They do not need to be implemented by a same object.
