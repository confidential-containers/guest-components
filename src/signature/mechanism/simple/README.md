# Simple Signing

Simple Signing is the first signature that CC supports. Refer to 
[CCv1 Image Security Design](../../../../docs/ccv1_image_security_design.md#image-signing).

## Policy Format

Simple Signing is verified due to the container's policy configuration file.

A Policy Requirement of Simple Signing should be like this

```json
{
    "type": "signedBy",
    "keyType": "<KEY-TYPE>",
    "keyData": "<PUBKEY-DATA-IN-BASE64>",
    "keyPath": "<PATH-TO-THE-PUBKEY>",
    "signedIdentity": <JSON-OBJECT>,
},
```

Here, 
* The `type` field must be `signedBy`, showing that this Policy Requirement
is for Simple Signing.
* The `keyType` field indicates the pubkey's type. Now only `GPGKeys` is supported.
* The `keyData` field includes the pubkey's content in base64.
* The `keyPath` field indicates the pubkey's path. And it **must be** `"/run/image-security/simple_signing/pubkey.gpg"`.
* `signedIdentity` includes a JSON object, refer to [signedIdentity](https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md#signedby) for detail.

**WARNING**: Must specify either `keyData` or `keyPath`, and must not both.

## Work flow

Let's go through the verification logic here.

What we all need to verify a signature are two things:
`signature`, `public key`.

* `public key` is given by the Policy Requirement, either by data
or path.
* Where the `signature` is stored (local path or remote url) is recorded in the `Sigstore Config File`, so we firstly need to create a dir to save `Sigstore Config File`, and then need to get the `Sigstore Config File`.
* After getting the `signature`, we can do the verification.

Let's see what the code do here:

1. `init()` will check and create the directory
* Sigstore Dir: `/run/image-security/simple_signing/sigstore_config`

2. Where an image's related signature is stored is defined in `Sigstore Configfile`. The uri of the `Sigstore Configfile` will be defined in `ImageClient.config.file_paths.sigstore_config`.
The `Sigstore Configfile` will be fetched.

3. Then access the `Sigstore Configfile`, and gather the signatures related to the image, and
do verifications.

## KBS ResourceDescription

To verify the signature signed by simple signing, there must be a
sigstore config file and a gpg pubkey.

Although the paths to the both are given in the policy file, when
the host starts, the two files are absent. Therefore we need to
gather them from kbs. 

Here are the two KBS Resource Descriptions
|Resource Descriptions| Expected Response from KBS |
|---|---|
|`Sigstore Config`|Sigstore Config|
|`GPG Keyring`| GPG Public key ring to verify the signature|
