//! # Signing schemes
//! different signatures defination and the top level interfaces.
//!
//! ### Design
//! Due to the format of policy requirement in
//! <https://github.com/containers/image/blob/main/docs/containers-policy.json.5.md#policy-requirements>,
//! a signing scheme is also treated as a policy
//! requirement. To support different kinds of signing
//! schemes, we use a trait [`SignScheme`] to define. The trait object
//! will be included into [`crate::policy::PolicyReqType`].

    /// This function will be called by `Agent`, to get the manifest
    /// of all the resources to be gathered from kbs. The gathering
    /// operation will happen after `init_scheme()`, to prepare necessary
    /// resources. The HashMap here uses &str rather than String,
